# üñºÔ∏è GIF Generator using ImageIO v3

This simple Python project creates an animated GIF from multiple image files using the **ImageIO v3** library.

---

## ‚ú® What This Project Does

This script takes a list of image files (for example, `team-pic1.png`, `team-pic2.png`) and combines them into a single animated GIF called **`team.gif`**.

Each frame in the GIF displays for **500 milliseconds**, and the animation loops **infinitely** (until you stop it).

In short:
- Reads multiple `.png` files
- Converts them into frames
- Combines all frames into one GIF
- Saves the final animation to disk
